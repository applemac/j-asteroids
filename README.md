Asteroids in Java
=================

This is an implementation of the classic Asteroids video arcade game using the Java programming language.

The game is a simple black screen with asteroids that float around. The objective of the game is to fly your space ship around the screen without getting hit by any asteroids, while at the same time shooting as many asteroids as possible.

Controls
--------

Currently the only three options available for the game are moving, stopping, and rotating. The following are the keys used for each option:
- W: Forward (Accelerate)
- A: Rotate Counter-clockwise
- S: Reverse (Slow down)
- D: Rotate Clockwise
- E: Stop the ship at the current location

More controls are to come as I implement them.

Running the Game
----------------

Included in the repository is a .jar executable file. It contains the game in its currently developed state. This can be run from the command line by using the following command:
```
java -jar asteroids.jar
```
