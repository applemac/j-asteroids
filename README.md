Asteroids in Java
=================

This is an implementation of the classic Asteroids video arcade game using the Java programming language.

The game is a simple black screen with asteroids that float around. The objective of the game is to fly your space ship around the screen without getting hit by any asteroids while at the same time shooting as many asteroids as possible and accumulating points.
