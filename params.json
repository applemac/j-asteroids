{"name":"Asteroids in Java","tagline":"An implementation of the classic arcade game Asteroids using Java.","body":"Asteroids in Java\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis is an bare bones implementation of the classic Asteroids video arcade game using the Java programming language.\r\n\r\nThe game is a simple black screen with asteroids that float around. The objective of the game is to fly your space ship around the screen without getting hit by any asteroids while at the same time shooting as many asteroids as possible and accumulating points.\r\n\r\n![alt text][screenshot]\r\n\r\nThe technical documentation for the game can be viewed [here][documentation].\r\n\r\nControls\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe following are the controls in the game:\r\n\r\n- W: Forward (Accelerate)\r\n- A: Rotate Counter-clockwise\r\n- S: Reverse (Slow down)\r\n- D: Rotate Clockwise\r\n- E: Stop the ship at the current location\r\n- Enter: Fire lasers\r\n\r\nScoring System\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe player is able to accumulate score by destroying asteroids during gameplay. Each asteroid destroyed earns the player 10 points. If the player's ship is hit by an asteroid, the player will return to the starting position and lose 10 points.\r\n\r\nAfter destroying all asteroids, the player will receive a final score and some statistics about the game such as total shots fired, asteroids destroyed, times ship exploded, and accuracy. The player can then exit the game using the exit button.\r\n\r\nRunning the Game\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nIncluded in the repository is a .jar executable file. It contains the game in its currently developed state. This can be run from the command line by using the following command:\r\n```\r\njava -jar asteroids.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n[documentation]: http://caseyscarborough.github.com/j-asteroids/doc/\r\n[screenshot]: https://github.com/caseyscarborough/j-asteroids/raw/master/resources/img/1.png \"The game's main layout.\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
